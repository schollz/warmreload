# warmreload

a norns mod to automatically reload scripts during development.

when enabled, this mod will reload a script anytime there is a change in the `code` directory. this is useful for fast prototyping and development. 

## installation

```
;install https://github.com/schollz/warmreload
```

`warmreload` 

Head to `SYSTEM > MODS` then select `warmreload` and turn `E2` until you  see a `+`` sign. then restart your norns. now anytime you save a script it will reload it.

_note:_ the first time you run a script after enabling, the script will need an internet connection to download a 4.5 MB binary that enables the watch service.
